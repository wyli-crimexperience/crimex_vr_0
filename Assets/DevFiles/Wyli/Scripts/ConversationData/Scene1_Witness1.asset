  - Thank you for speaking with us, Mr. Borromeo. Can you tell us what you saw?
  - "Yeah\u2026 I was at home, watching TV. Around 8 p.m., I heard a loud thud from
    next door. It was strange, but I figured maybe someone dropped something heavy."
  - "About fifteen minutes later, I thought I heard footsteps outside, but when I
    looked out the window, no one was there. That\u2019s all I noticed."
  - Thank you, Mr. Borromeo. This is helpful.
