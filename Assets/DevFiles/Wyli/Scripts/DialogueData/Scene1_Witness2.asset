  - speakerName: You
    speakerText: Thank you for speaking with us, Ms. Salvatore. Can you tell us what
      you saw?
  - speakerName: Ms. Salvatore
    speakerText: I own a mini store inside my home and I sold Jose Martinez and his
      friend two 2x2 bottles of gin. I can hear them laughing while watching a basketball
      game at his TV. A few moments later I heard arguments and then a glass shattered...
      and then a loud thud... Then it was silent after that.
  - speakerName: You
    speakerText: After the silence, what did you do?
  - speakerName: Ms. Salvatore
    speakerText: "I just peeped through the window and that\u2019s when I saw Jose
      lying on the floor with blood all over his body. I immediately called the nearby
      police."
  - speakerName: You
    speakerText: Thank you Ms. Salvatore, this is helpful. Would it be okay if we
      invite you to be a witness when this case goes up to court?
  - speakerName: Ms. Salvatore
    speakerText: Me...? What if his friend shows up at my door? My life would be
      put in danger!
  - speakerName: You
    speakerText: Do not worry Ms. Salvatore, we have a arranged a program for the
      protection of our witnesses like you.
  - speakerName: Ms. Salvatore
    speakerText: Okay, I trust you in this, sir.
