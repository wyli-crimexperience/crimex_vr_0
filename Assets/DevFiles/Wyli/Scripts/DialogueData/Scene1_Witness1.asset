    speakerText: Thank you for speaking with us, Mr. Borromeo. Can you tell us what
      you saw?
  - speakerName: Mr. Borromeo
    speakerText: "Yeah\u2026 I was at home, watching TV. Around 8 p.m., I heard a
      loud thud from next door. It was strange, but I figured maybe someone dropped
      something heavy."
  - speakerName: Mr. Borromeo
    speakerText: "About fifteen minutes later, I thought I heard footsteps outside,
      but when I looked out the window, no one was there. That\u2019s all I noticed."
  - speakerName: You
    speakerText: Thank you, Mr. Borromeo. This is helpful. Would it be okay if we
      invite you to be a witness when this case goes up to court?
  - speakerName: Mr. Borromeo
    speakerText: Absolutely. Anything to serve justice for our fellow neighbor.
